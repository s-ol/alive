`alv` ("alive") is a language for creating and changing realtime programs while
they are running continuously. It can be used to create music, visuals or
installations, but by itself creates neither sound nor video. Rather, `alv` is
used together with other tools and synthesizers (for example
[SuperCollider][supercollider] or [Pilot][pilot]). In such an ensemble of
tools, `alive` takes the role of a 'conductor', telling the other tools what to
play when by sending commands to them using a variety of protocols, such as OSC
and MIDI.
