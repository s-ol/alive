# `alive` - livecoding with persistent expressions

`alivecoding` is a new type of programming environment and language
specifically designed for (live) performances where code is edited while it is
running, such as *livecoding* or *algorave* music performances.

Unlike other livecoding languages, programming with `alivecoding` does not
mean evaluating separate pieces of code and sending individual commands to the
programming environment. Instead, you can keep editing the program as a whole
and whenever you save the file, `alive` will apply your changes to the running
system seamlessly, without resetting any part of your program (unless you want
it to).

If you want to learn more or try out `alivecoding` yourself, the
[getting started][guide] page is a good place to start. On the other hand, if
you are a curious about the motivations and concepts behind `alivecoding`,
you can find more in-depth information on these topics in the
['persistent expressions' introductory article][rationale].
