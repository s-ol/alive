#(this is equivalent to:
  (def osc (require 'osc'))
  (def out osc/out))
([2]use ([1]require 'osc'))

#(there should probably be a shorthand for this,
  but i'm not sure what to call it.
  maybe it could be just
  (require time) - note its a symbol not a string here)
([4]def time ([3]require 'time'))
 
([6]out '127.0.0.1' 9000 '/param/radius/set' ([5]time/lfo 0.5))
([8]out '127.0.0.1' 9000 '/param/offset/set' ([7]time/lfo 1.2 'saw'))
